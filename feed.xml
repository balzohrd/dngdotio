        <title>That Never Fading Smile</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;l-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/tnfsB.jpg&quot;&gt; That Never Fading Smile is a collaboration website between D &amp;amp; G Web Remedies and Friends. It is dedicated to the loving memory of Levon Thomas, a friend, son, brother, and cousin that left us much too soon. After losing our dear friend, we needed a space to continue to share the passion we all have for music and create a place where other music lovers such as ourselves, could share what they’re listing to, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ThatNeverFadingSmile.com&quot; class=&quot;visitbtn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Visit The Site &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-angle-double-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Our Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What truly began as a form of self-expression and in many ways, a platform to mourn the loss of a loved one, quickly turned into an exciting and fun side project we are deeply passionate about. &lt;img class=&quot;r-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/tnfsM.jpg&quot;&gt; As music lovers inspired by sounds, riffs and lyrics of various genres from all around the world, we never imagined that this site would receive the response it has. Since we love finding and sharing new artists and song with our friends anyway, this site has also become a great source for visitors to discover cool new music. Check it out, Listen, Enjoy and always rock That Never Fading Smile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Back End&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Never Fading Smile runs on Jekyll, a simple, blog-friendly, static site generator and accesses audio files directly from Soundcloud playlists handpicked and updated weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Words Wine Women</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;l-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/wwwB.jpg&quot;&gt; Words, Wine and Women is an exciting video web series about women empowerment that offers a unique look into the realm of today’s woman. They needed a website for this new web series to match their strong, intelligent, dynamic and unique supportive forum that features weekly video segments that could also easily be updated weekly with new videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordswinewomen.com&quot; class=&quot;visitbtn&quot;&gt;Visit The Site &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-angle-double-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were intrigued when the founder of Words, Wine and Women came to us to create a platform where she could present her idea of a new type of talk-show for women. The concept was simple and genius; put 5 females in a room, mix in a little wine, and get some pretty interesting conversations. Our goal was to create a supportive forum where women (and men) could feel comfortable enough to challenge each other on hot topics all while having a blast. Although we didn’t get to join in on any of the racy conversations, it was our job to design a great looking (sexy) and easy to use website. The founder of the site had developed a branding identity, so we worked with the style and colors already in place as a starting point for the design. And yes, a lot of pink was involved. The result? &lt;img class=&quot;r-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/wwwM.jpg&quot;&gt; A design that looks quite different from most of the other sites we’ve done. This color scheme is traditional and feminine yet bold and fresh to appeal to the “modern women” Words, Wine and Women directly targets. Built on a simple, customized Wordpress theme, the site is easy to manage, update and upload and publish new videos to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Season One, Success!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Words, Wine and Women really kicked off after debuting their first season in early 2015. The production value and talents of each host on the web series are truly the stars of the show. Our designs simply help to feature these videos so the women of Words, Wine and Women can have fun doing all the talking!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Imagineer Remodeling</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;l-image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/imagineB.jpg&quot;&gt; Imagineer Remodeling needed a website and branding that would represent their European-style custom home construction and remodeling company. We worked with them to create an identity that did just that - and a responsive website to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;visitbtn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Visit The Site &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-angle-double-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Branding and Digital Identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a brand new business, Imagineer Remodeling needed to create both a branding and digital identity. They wanted their brand to portray elegance and class while still being affordable and attainable to the average homeowner. After sorting out their new logo, we moved on to tackling the design of the website. We integrated a Wordpress theme, with a customized dashboard that allows the Imagineer team to easily update their site with new project galleries, articles and information. While website viewers can easily find projects they were looking for, information about home remodeling and tons of DIY tips for homeowners. We set up categories, tags and short codes within the content management system to make updating the site fast and searching for projects even easier! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of their challenges was competing with more established construction companies with large advertising and marketing budgets that were using traditional advertising methods (TV, radio, direct mail, specialty magazines). Imagineer Remodeling decided to focus on both their website and online presence in addition to traditional advertising methods. This meant creating content – a lot of content – and regularly creating new, interesting, engaging content through a strategic content marketing campaign. Informational pages about the company, galleries and interactive design pages were styled to show off their work and give as much relevant detail as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;&quot;src=&quot;/assets/images/imagineM.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Galleries &amp;amp; Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We setup a light box so that viewers could browse the gorgeous project photos distraction-free in one of the many project galleries on the site.  We also integrated search filters to make it easier to find projects based on categories and tags.&lt;/p&gt;
